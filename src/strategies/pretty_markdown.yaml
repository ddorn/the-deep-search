    You are part of the pipeline of a search engine that searches through podcasts.
    GOAL: You process sections of automatically generated podcast transcripts to make them pleasant to read, browse or skim for a human reader.

    Your task is to rewrite the following podcast section transcript in a pleasant to read markdown file. For this:
    - Add headers for sections
    Add bullet points as often as you can, but not always. Use a dash and one space (like so "- content") for lists.
    - Add numbered lists when things are enumerated
    - Add bold and italics to highlight important concepts or ideas. Those are great entrypoints in the middle of the text for readers.
    - You can fix small transcriptions issues (repeated words, typos, etc.)
    - There's a title at the start of the section, keep it, with the same depth of heading (e.g. keep ### if there are three #)

    There are 3 important constraints
    - The text contains many `<sync-id="...">`. You need to keep them where they are relative to the words around them.
      - For instance "I like <sync-id="4">apples" needs to keep the sync-id just before the word apple.
      - If some words are removed, for instance because the text was "I like<sync-id="8"> like apples", keep it between the same words that are kept, so between the first "like" and the "apple"
      - Spacing around the sync tokens: the text should be normal (i.e. exactly one space between prose words, the right amount in code...) when the sync tokens are removed. So an output of "I like <sync-id="8"> apples" or "I like<sync-id="8">apples" are bad, as removing the sync tokens would leave 2 spaces, or 0 spaces between the words, respectively.
    - Rewrite the whole text. All of the content should be present in your output, you should not remove nor add content, but you need to only add formating and fix mistakes.
    - Output only the reformatted section, with no comments.

    ### Refocusing on Secondary Harms and Personal Values

    Remember the importance of **secondary harms**.<sync-id="993.36"> The way to do that is to keep remembering what it<sync-id="1000.66"> is that you *do* care about. This is the key message of **digital minimalism**:

    -   **What do you value?**
    -   **How do<sync-id="1005.44"> you want to spend your time?**

    If you don't have good answers for that (and don't worry, you probably<sync-id="1008.88"> don't, especially if you're young), recognize that this takes time and experimentation. Go start searching.<sync-id="1013.72">

    -   Try things.
    -   Connect to people.
    -   Reflect.

    Begin to find the things that give you a deeper,<sync-id="1019.22"> richer, thicker sense of **value**.

    Then, begin to assess other things in your life<sync-id="1024.14"> based on whether they are *helping* those values or *getting in the way*. Right?

    The **secondary harms** are reduced<sync-id="1029.70"> when we begin to embrace stuff that really matters in our lives. It completely changes our relationships with our phones.<sync-id="1034.30">

    So, unless you're like a tech journalist or a technology investor, I don't know how much time you should be spending thinking about how exactly specific tools are being run, who is in charge of them, or what's good or bad about them.<sync-id="1044.71">

    What you should be thinking instead is:
    -   **What is this doing in my life?**<sync-id="1047.95">
    -   **Am I spending more time on things I care about, or less?**<sync-id="1050.95">

    If the answer is *less*, then you need to curtail this technology's use, either completely or by putting significant fences around it.
